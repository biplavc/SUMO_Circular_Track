# SUMO_Circular_Track

1. Makes a certain number of vehicles move around in a circular track generated in SUMO and edited in NETEDIT. A text file is generated that logs the actual location of the vehicles every 0.1 seconds (configurable).

2. To view the simulation in SUMO GUI, type 'sumo-gui circles.sumocfg'. For just viewing the simulation, comment out the code in circles.py that generates the text file of vehicle locations as it slows down the simulation.

3. Before executing circles.py, convert circles.py to an executable program using 'chmod +x circles.py'. Then type './circles.py' which will bring up the sumo-gui. Then run the simulation from the gui and locations will start getting saved to the file.
